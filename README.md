# Compiler_Design_Project
This is a vary small project .This validates the c for loop by taking C program as input.
While giving C code as input one should maintain proper space between all words inside forloop, this is validating only the for loop.
Errors willbe in ErrorFile.txt, input should be in testFile.txt,syntax table will be generated and will be shown in the terminal.
